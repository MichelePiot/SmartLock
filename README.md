## Project Description

SmartLock was a collaboration project with a small design team looking to create a product that increases the security of computers within the workplace.

The purpose of the product was to ensure users that their computers or personal devices locked automatically when they stepped away while their phones were still in their possession; providing a simple automated action while simultaneously enhancing security of themselves and their work.

Once the user's mobile device was no longer detected to be in the range of the user's computer or personal device, it would automatically lock, mitigating the risk of exposing personal information or documents because of an unattended, unlocked computer.

### User Experience Integration

Being a part of this design team allowed for the opportunity to work collaboratively with different engineers and designers. I was able to combine my own sights and skills with others on the team making for a well-rounded development of a product.

Integrating user experience within this design creates an experience that is simplistic for user's of all ages and occupations to use.

While discussing the development of the product, I was able to identify the use case for this type of software. From personal experiences, it was clear this product would mitigate the use of a keyboard control or extra step in locking a computer.

#### Role as a User Experience Designer

Working alongside the lead software engineer, I was able to assist in the role of a designer by adding insight to what was needed for user's to be able to easily interact with their product.

Coming from a software engineer viewpoint, it was essential to include insights to user experience within this project because building software and using software can be two different aspects of a product. It became my role to integrate the two and design an interface that displays the information in a user-friendly way.

### Research

Research was conducted to determine which design outline was most appliciable to the desired look and feel of the product. 

The overall design goal was to create a product that was simple and easy to use. The user would need to be able to connect to their desired device via bluetooth, like their personal computer, and manage such device when needed. 

The target audience for this project came down to people who generally computer literate and are using their computers regularly for both a work need and personal use. 

#### Key Features

* Easy and simplistic to use
* Clean design and layout
* Display of connected devices
* General directions/informaion

### Wireframing

After discussing the desired look and feel of the product itself, I was able to design some wireframes based on the initial vision of the product.

Essentially, a set-up page was required for users to be able to connect to, allowing them to use the product. Ultimatly a mobile app was decided the best tool to use for set up. 

*All wireframes were created using Figma.*

### Prototyping

Based on the wireframes that were developed, I was able to prototype some initial design ideas and highlight the key features that were desired for the product.

The prototypes above highlight specific desired attributes of the product. We can see there is a central theme in which the user is able to identify their devices and select their desired device to connect too.
